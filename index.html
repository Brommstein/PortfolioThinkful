        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <!-- Description that shows passion for 'Web Design' -->
        <p>Born in a small town called Springtown, I grew up with very few people around me and due to that, have gained a fascination towards video games.</p>
        <p>After graduating high school, I left my hometown and proceeded to live in Houston for two years. After experiencing a bit of city life, my family purchased a small house in Katy and settled down.</p>
        <p>Living in Katy now allowed me to proceed with my dream of becoming a video game developer and so I started to attend school. Sadly though, due to financial issues, I was not able to complete my full degree with my community college.</p>
        <p>Now I am working harder than ever along with a few of my best friends to solidify my knowledge of coding and create a possible future for ourselves!</p>
        <!-- Two other interests besides 'Web Designer' -->
        <p>My other interests would involve...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Writing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Give me a shout out!</p>
